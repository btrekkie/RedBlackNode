/**
 * A node in a red-black tree ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree ). Compared to a class like Java's
 * TreeMap, RedBlackNode is a low-level data structure. The internals of a node are exposed as public fields, allowing
 * clients to directly observe and manipulate the structure of the tree. This gives clients flexibility, although it
 * also enables them to violate the red-black or BST properties. The RedBlackNode class provides methods for performing
 * various standard operations, such as insertion and removal.
 *
 * Unlike most implementations of binary search trees, RedBlackNode supports arbitrary augmentation. By subclassing
 * RedBlackNode, clients can add arbitrary data and augmentation information to each node. For example, if we were to
 * use a RedBlackNode subclass to implement a sorted set, the subclass would have a field storing an element in the set.
 * If we wanted to keep track of the number of non-leaf nodes in each subtree, we would store this as a "size" field and
 * override augment() to update this field. All RedBlackNode methods (such as "insert" and remove()) call augment() as
 * necessary to correctly maintain the augmentation information, unless otherwise indicated.
 *
 * The values of the tree are stored in the non-leaf nodes. RedBlackNode does not support use cases where values must be
 * stored in the leaf nodes. It is recommended that all of the leaf nodes in a given tree be the same (black)
 * RedBlackNode instance, to save space. The root of an empty tree is a leaf node, as opposed to null.
 *
 * For reference, a red-black tree is a binary search tree satisfying the following properties:
 *
 * - Every node is colored red or black.
 * - The leaf nodes, which are dummy nodes that do not store any values, are colored black.
 * - The root is black.
 * - Both children of each red node are black.
 * - Every path from the root to a leaf contains the same number of black nodes.
 *
 * @param <N> The type of node in the tree. For example, we might have
 *     "class FooNode<T> extends RedBlackNode<FooNode<T>>".

     *
     * "Augmentation information" is information that we can compute about a subtree rooted at some node, preferably
     * based only on the augmentation information in the node's two children and the information in the node.  Examples
     * of augmentation information are the sum of the values in a subtree and the number of non-leaf nodes in a subtree.
     * Augmentation information may not depend on the colors of the nodes.
     *
     * This method returns whether the augmentation information in any of the ancestors of this node might have been
     * affected by changes in this subtree since the last call to augment().  In the usual case, where the augmentation
     * information depends only on the information in this node and the augmentation information in its immediate
     * children, this is equivalent to whether the augmentation information changed as a result of this call to
     * augment().  For example, in the case of subtree size, this returns whether the value of the size field prior to
     * calling augment() differed from the size field of the left child plus the size field of the right child plus one.
     * False positives are permitted.  The return value is unspecified if we have not called augment() on this node
     * before.
     *
     * This method may assume that this is not a leaf node.  It may not assume that the augmentation information stored
     * in any of the tree's nodes is correct.  However, if the augmentation information stored in all of the node's
     * descendants is correct, then the augmentation information stored in this node must be correct after calling
